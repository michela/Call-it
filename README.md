Wrapper app to assist with interacting and commenting on a 3rd party website

This app is the result of being presented with one too many "It's Un-australian" beer coasters, powers, television commercials and other campaign materials at the same time as hearing about family members putting their entire dole allowance into poker machines.

Mandatory pre-commitment is a complicated issue I don't pretend to fully understand but I know bullshit when I see it.
